# Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data Analysis

This project analyzes Fitbit fitness tracker data to uncover insights into users' daily activities, sleep patterns, and weight metrics. By examining these datasets, the analysis aims to identify trends and correlations that can inform health and wellness strategies.

## Overview

Wearable fitness trackers like Fitbit collect extensive data on users' physical activities, sleep habits, and other health-related metrics. This project utilizes such data to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), aiming to extract meaningful patterns and relationships that can contribute to a better understanding of user behaviors and health outcomes.

## Dataset

* **Source**: The dataset is publicly available and has been used in various data analysis projects, including those on Kaggle.
* **Contents**:

  * `dailyActivity_merged.csv`: Records of users' daily activities, including steps taken, distance covered, and calories burned.
  * `sleepDay_merged.csv`: Information on users' sleep patterns, such as total minutes asleep and time in bed.
  * `weightLogInfo_merged.csv`: Data on users' weight measurements and BMI.

## Project Structure

* `Fitbit Data Analysis.R`: R script containing the code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
* `dailyActivity_merged.csv`: Dataset with daily activity metrics.
* `sleepDay_merged.csv`: Dataset with sleep information.
* `weightLogInfo_merged.csv`: Dataset with weight and BMI records.
